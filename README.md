The exquisite corpse game 

This is an incredibly simple game, inspired by the Surrealist game Exquisite Corpse:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse

Instead of lines to continue a picture, exquisite games pass command-line arguments to one-another.

Since this is the first iteration of Exquisite Game that I know of, we chose something simple to pass.
For this iteration, a pair of integers.


Example Usage:

python exquisite.py -good_big 42 -bad_big 66

(78, 22)
